# Computational Photography Projects
## UC Berkeley CS 180 | Fall 2023

These are my projects from [CS 180](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs180/fa23/), a class taught by [Alexei (Alyosha) Efros](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/) and [Angjoo Kanazawa](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kanazawa/). The class focuses on computing with visual data, which includes the image processing, computer vision, computational photography, and the use of convolutional neural networks.

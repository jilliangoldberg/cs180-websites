# Computational Photography Projects
## UC Berkeley CS 180 | Fall 2023

These are my projects from [CS 180](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs180/fa23/), a class taught by [Alexei (Alyosha) Efros](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/) and [Angjoo Kanazawa](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kanazawa/). The class focuses on computing with visual data, which includes the image processing, computer vision, computational photography, and the use of convolutional neural networks.
### Final Project
My final project was comprised of 3 different projects demonstrating different techniques for image manipulation.
1. **Gradient Domain Fusion:** This project implemented a technique used for blending, tone-mapping, and non-photorealistic rendering, which we used to seamlessly blend objects into target images.

2. **Image Quilting:** This project involves creating a larger texture image from a small sample by sampling patches and ensuring similarities in overlapping regions.

3. **Lightfield Camera**: This project mimics depth refocusing and aperature adjustment by capturing an array of images over a plane orthogonal to the object and using simple techniques such as shifting and averaging.

### Project 1: Colorizing the [Prokudin-Gorskii](https://www.loc.gov/collections/prokudin-gorskii/) photo collection
